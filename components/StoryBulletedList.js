        <li>I was in an abusive relationship for 10 years</li>
        <li>I had three children with my abuser</li>
        <li>I slowly lost all of my support system: family, friends, coworkers</li>
        <li>I was granted four legal protection orders from my abuser</li>
        <li>The protection orders did not matter: I was almost killed three times</li>
        <li>I went from healthy and stable to unemployed and almost homeless</li>
        <li>The abuse ended in January 2025 when my abuser killed himself</li>
        <li>Despite this ending, the physical, psychological, sexual, and financial abuse demolished me</li>
        <li>I cannot get a job because I have no way of paying for childcare during the summer</li>
        <li>I cannot pay for most necessities, because public assistance only supports food and utilities</li>
        <li>All I want is to get back on my feet, for me and my children</li>
      </ul>
